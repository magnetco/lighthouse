#### First Comment (Maker Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Lighthouse because I was tired of constantly running `lsof` 
to figure out what was using port 3000, or checking Docker Desktop 
just to restart a container.

Lighthouse puts all that info in your menu bar:
• Local ports with framework detection
• Docker containers with one-click management
• Website monitoring with uptime tracking

It's free, open source, and respects your privacy—no accounts, 
no cloud, no tracking.

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful 
for your workflow?
```

#### Engagement Plan

**Hour 0-2:** Respond to every comment immediately
**Hour 2-8:** Check every 30 minutes
**Hour 8-16:** Check every hour
**Hour 16-24:** Check every 2 hours

### Support Network

Before launch, reach out to:
- Friends/colleagues who use Product Hunt
- Developer communities (Discord, Slack)
- Twitter followers
- Email list (if any)

Ask them to:
1. Upvote early in the day
2. Leave a genuine comment
3. Share on their social media

**Don't ask for fake engagement**—it's against PH rules and obvious.

### Post-Launch

#### Day 1-2
- Thank everyone who supported
- Respond to remaining comments
- Share results on social media

#### Day 3-7
- Write a retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
- Follow up with people who showed interest
- Implement quick-win feature suggestions

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Upvotes | 100+ |
| Comments | 20+ |
| Final rank | Top 10 of the day |
| GitHub stars | +50 |
| Downloads | +100 |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Launching on a Friday or weekend

- ❌ Fake accounts or vote manipulation
- ❌ Not having a working product ready
