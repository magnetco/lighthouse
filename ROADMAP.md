# Lighthouse Roadmap 🗺️

This document outlines potential features and enhancements for Lighthouse, organized by category and priority.

## Current State

Lighthouse is a macOS menu bar app that monitors:
- **Local Development Servers** ("In the Harbor") - Active TCP ports with process information
- **Remote Websites** ("Out at Sea") - HTTP/HTTPS endpoints with ping monitoring
- **Docker Containers** ("Container Ships") - Full Docker container management

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Menu Bar Status Indicator
- Icon color changes based on overall system health (green/orange/red/gray)
- Provides at-a-glance status without opening the menu

#### Desktop Notifications
- Alerts when websites go down or recover
- Notifications when dev servers start or stop
- Smart notification system prevents spam
- Uses native macOS notification system

#### Environment Profiles
- Switch between Dev/Staging/Production configurations
- Each profile has its own website list and refresh interval
- Quick profile switching from menu bar
- Persists across app restarts

#### Log Viewing
- View process logs directly in the app
- Color-coded log levels (error, warning, info)
- Auto-scroll toggle and copy to clipboard
- Shows last 100 lines from system logs

#### Docker Integration
- List all containers (running and stopped)
- Start/stop/restart/remove containers
- View and click port mappings
- Real-time status updates with color indicators

#### Framework Icon System
- Automatic framework detection for 35+ frameworks
- Visual icons for Next.js, Vite, React, Django, Flask, Node.js, Docker, Python, Prisma
- Fallback to SF Symbols when custom icons unavailable
- Internal/external website detection

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Keep memory footprint low (important for menu bar apps)
- Efficient polling strategies (don't hammer endpoints)
- Background thread management for monitoring
- Lazy loading for historical data

### Security
- Secure storage for API keys and credentials
- Sandboxing considerations for macOS
- User permission requests (network, file system)
- Safe handling of shell commands

### Compatibility
- Maintain macOS 13.0+ support
- Test on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- Consider future SwiftUI API changes
- Backward compatibility for stored data

---

## Community & Distribution

### Future Considerations
- App Store distribution
- Homebrew cask support
- Auto-update mechanism
- Crash reporting and analytics (opt-in)
- User feedback system
- Documentation site
- Video tutorials
