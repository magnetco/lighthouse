## Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors

| App | Focus | Lighthouse Advantage |
|-----|-------|---------------------|
| iStat Menus | System resources | We focus on services, not CPU/RAM |
| Stats | System monitor | No service awareness |
| Proxyman | Network debugging | We're simpler, complementary |
| TablePlus menu bar | Database connections | We're broader |

### Indirect Alternatives

| Tool | Limitation | Lighthouse Advantage |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| `lsof` command | Requires terminal, parsing | Beautiful UI, auto-refresh |
| Docker Desktop | Only Docker, heavy | Lighter, includes non-Docker services |
| Uptime Robot | Cloud-based, external | Local, private, no limits |
| Datadog | Enterprise, expensive | Free, simple, local |

### Unique Value Proposition
